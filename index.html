          Right now, in your area, people are quietly searching for help.

        <p>
          Not with forms.<br>

          Most of this never reaches your dashboards.<br>
          You only see the late stage: crisis, appointments, unplanned care.

        <p>
          What if you could see the early signals, in plain English, and act before things broke.

          A <span class="highlight">Support Playlist</span> appears. A small, human set of next steps:

          <li>A local walking group</li>

          She does not need to know the name of a service.<br>
          She does not need to understand the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          She just says what is happening.<br>
          The Support Playlist quietly gathers what might help.

        <ul>
          <li>How many people are asking for help with anxiety</li>
          <li>Where money, food, and housing appear together</li>

          <li>What people try before approaching the GP</li>
          <li>Which needs rise first, and where</li>

        <p>
          DSI turns everyday requests into a <span class="highlight">live view of demand</span>.

        <p>It helps you:</p>

          <li>Shape provision rather than react to crisis</li>

          Over 28 days, the Weymouth and Portland PCN website quietly became a <span class="highlight">neighbourhood signal layer</span>.

          This is real engagement, not casual clicking.
        </p>
        <p>
          People found it directly.<br>
          People found it through Google.<br>
          People arrived from Microsoft Teams, pcnquicklinks.org and thelocalsocial.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ecosystem is beginning to work as intended.
        </p>

        <p>
          The strongest signal is <span class="highlight">mental health and wellbeing</span>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>55 unique visitors</li>
          <li>71 total visits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Followed by healthy living, then crisis and safety.</p>

        <p>People are also looking for:</p>
        <ul class="two-column">
          <li>Caring for someone</li>
          <li>Food and money help</li>
          <li>Community support</li>
          <li>Family and parenting</li>
          <li>Home and housing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Framing the site around <span class="highlight">everyday needs</span>, not clinical labels, is working.<br>
          People see themselves immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most use Microsoft Edge, Chrome or Safari, suggesting both NHS staff and residents are moving through the same front door.

          In one month, the pilot is already:

        </p>
        <p>
          For PCNs, ICSs, Integrated Neighbourhood Teams and local partners, it shows:

        <ul>

          <li>Which communities need food or money support</li>

          It is anonymous.<br>
          It is aggregated.<br>
          It is local.
        </p>
        <p>
          It gives you a shared map of strain, resilience, and opportunity.<br>
